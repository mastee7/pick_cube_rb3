# RB3 Color Cube Perception and Grasping

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- **`rb3/`**: Contains code running on the **Qualcomm RB3 board**, including image capture, object/pose detection using YOLO, and the logic node that manages perception and planning.
- **`jetson_nano/`**: Contains code running on the **Jetson Nano**, specifically for motor control and executing commands received from the RB3.

Each folder has its own `README.md` for more details.
