# RB3 Codebase

This folder contains the code that runs on the RB3 board. It includes:

### 1. Image Capture
Captures real-time video or images using a connected camera.

### 2. Vision Pipeline
Uses a YOLO-based object detection pipeline to detect and classify objects in the scene.

### 3. Logic Node
This ROS2 node performs decision-making based on vision output and sends appropriate control messages to the Jetson Nano.

## ðŸ›  Setup & Run Instructions

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
cd /home/ubuntu/bin/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash 
colcon build
