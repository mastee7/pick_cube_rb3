# Jetson Nano Codebase

This folder contains the control-related code running on Jetson Nano. It is responsible for:

- Receiving commands from the RB3's logic node
- Sending appropriate signals to actuators (e.g., motors)

## Structure
```bash
jetson_nano/
â”œâ”€â”€ control_node/ # ROS2 node to receive commands and drive hardware
â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file
```

## Features
- Serial communication or direct GPIO motor control
- Real-time command handling and execution
- Supports different motor drivers (specify in configs)
